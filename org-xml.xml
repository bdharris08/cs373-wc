            <description>The DEA was established on July 1, 1973 by Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973 which was signed by President Richard Nixon on July 28, 1973. The plan proposed the creation of a single federal agency to enforce federal drug laws and consolidate and coordinated the government's drug control activities. Congress accepted the proposal and the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs and the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement merged o create the DEA. The current DEA Administrator is Michele Leonhart and the current DEA Chief of Operations is Thomas M. Harrigan.</description>
            <relationToCrisis>The DEA is attempting to crack down on Bath Salts on the local and national level. There are many elements used to synthesize bath salts and the DEA is trying to get them added to the federal list of illegal substances. If this is accomplished, it will make it easier to prosecute the criminals who import, sell, and possess the chemicals.</relationToCrisis>

            <description>The US Congress created the War Department in 1789 and the Navy Department in 1798. In 1945 President Truman proposed the creation of a unified department of state defense, citing both wasteful military spending and inter-departmental conflicts. In 1947, President Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947, which set up a unified military command known as the National Military Establishment. The National Military Establishment was renamed the Department of Defense on August 10, 1949, in an amendment to the original 1947 law.</description>

            <description>The Federal Reserve System was created on December 23, 1913 through the Federal Reserve Act. This was in response to a series of panics, particularly the Panic of 1907 when the NYSE fell almost 50% from its peak the previous year. Since then, the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System have expanded and the structure has evolved. Ben Bernanke is the current Chairman of the Federal Reserve System.</description>

            <kind>An international assembly of 193 member states</kind>
            <description>The United Nations was established in 1945 to replace the League of Nations, which failed to prevent World War II. The main goal of the organization is to maintain international peace and promote cooperation in solving international problems. The UN Conference on International Organization began on April 25, 1945 with 50 governments in attendance. The UN Charter was ratified on October 24, 1945 by France, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom (the five permanent members of the Security Council at the time) as well as a majority of the other 46 signatories. The UN was originally based at the Sperry Gyroscope Corporation's facility in Lake Success, New York, from 1946-1952, before being moved to the UN Headquarters building in Manhattan. The United Nations currently has 193 member states.</description>
            <relationToCrisis>Since 1959, the UN has passed four resolutions on Tibet (in 1959, 1961, 1965, and 1991). Since then, there have been motions to hold China accountable for its actions in Tibet, but lobbying by China has blocked any progress.</relationToCrisis>
