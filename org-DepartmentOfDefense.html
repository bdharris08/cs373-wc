<h2> History</h2>
<p>
The US Congress created the War Department in 1789 and the Navy Department in 1798. In 1945 President Truman proposed the creation of a unified department of state defense, citing both wasteful military spending and inter-departmental conflicts. In 1947, President Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947, which set up a unified military command known as the National Military Establishment. The National Military Establishment was renamed the Department of Defense on August 10, 1949, in an amendment to the original 1947 law.
