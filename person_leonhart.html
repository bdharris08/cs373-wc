<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Michele Marie Leonhart is an American career law enforcement officer and currently the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency. She graduated with a degree in Criminal Justice from Bemidji State University of Minnesota in 1978 and went on to work as a police officer in Baltimore Maryland before moving into the DEA in 1980. She spent the next several years moving up the ranks in the DEA before becoming the Special Agent in charge of the Los Angeles Field Division which put her in charge of all enforcement and administrative operations in Los Angeles, Nevada, Hawaii, Guam, and Saipan. This made her the first female ever promoted to the position of "Special Agent in Charge." She was nominated in 2008 by former President George W.
