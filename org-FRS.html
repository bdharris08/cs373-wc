The Federal Reserve System was created on December 23, 1913 through the Federal Reserve Act. This was in response to a series of panics, particularly the Panic of 1907 when the NYSE fell almost 50% from its peak the previous year. Since then, the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System have expanded and the structure has evolved. Ben Bernanke is the current Chairman of the Federal Reserve System.
