    <name>Rwanda Genocide</name>

    <info>

      <history>There had always been heavy ethnic tension between the majority Hutu people and the Tutsis in Rwanda since the country's establishment. The Hutu both resented and feared the Tutsi minority for the decades of oppression they had to withstand. They finally overthew the Tutsi monarchy in a rebellion in 1959-1962 and established their own Hutu lead government. In the years following, social, economic, and political pressures grew and the Hutu political elite blamed the entire Tutsi minority for these problems. Soon after, a Tutsi-dominated rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, made a push to overthrow the Hutu led government; this led to a civil war and heavier resentment of the Tutsi people. The civil war ended in 1994 where President Juvenal Habyarimana signed a cease-fire with the Tutsi rebel group.  

In April 1994, shortly after President Habyarimana's plane was shot down violence errupted overnight in cities and towns around the country. The Hutu extremist political party had organized two primary militia groups to carry out the genocide of the Tutsis in advance in order to maintain their political power/influence. These two groups carried out mass murders on Tutsi men, women, and children, as well as Hutu people who were against the murders. Though the two militia groups were responsible for initiating many of the attacks on the Tutsi people, the actual murders were carried out by Hutu civilians; they were given the order by militia groups to either kill their Tutsi friends/neighbors or be killed themselves. Many Hutu civilians had no trouble killing them since there was much resent towards them over the past years. This genocide continued for three months until the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a rebel group composed of mostly Tutsi refugees, defeated the Hutu perpetrator regime and its supporters.</history>

    <name>2010 Chilean Earthquake</name>

    <info>

      <history>Chile's Pacific coast lies on the "Ring of Fire", the line frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that circles the Pacific rim.  There has been 123 documented notable earthquakes with its epicenter within Chile since 1570.  The largest magintude earthquake occurred May 22, 1960 with a magnitude of 9.5, which is to date the most powerful earthquake ever recorded on earth.  The most recent earthquake occurred March 25, 2012 with a magnitude of 7.1.  This history of frequent earthquakes has made Chile one of the most well-prepared nations against earthquakes.  Chile has strict building codes, robust emergency response, and an educated population. Homes and buildings in Chile are built to ride out earthquakes, their steel skeletons designed to sway with seismic waves.  Also Chile has the most world-renowned seismologists and earthquake engineers per capita. These professionals are heeded by the government to advise in government contingency planning.  Finally, the people in Chile have most likely experienced an earthquake before and know how to react when one occurs (by sheltering under tables and door frames).

An earthquake of 8.8 magnitude occured off the coast of central Chile, lasting for about three minutes.  The earthquake ranks as the sixth largest earthquake recorded and was felt throughout most of Chile and many other South American countries.  It also triggered a tsunami which devastated the south-central Chilean coast and damaged areas in California and Japan. The earthquake generated a blackout that affected 93% of the country, lasting several days.  Chile was declared to be in a "state of catastrophe" by President Michelle Bachelet, who deployed military troops to take control of the most affected areas.  525 people lost their lives and 9% of the population lost their homes.  The total loss to Chilean economy is estimated to be at US$15-30 billion.</history>

    <info>

      <history>1997 was the first year that cases of human-infecting H5N1 arose. 18 Humans were infected and 6 died in Hong Kong. H5N1 re-emerged in January 2003 in mainland China, killing 2 out of the 3 people infected. In 2004, 32 of 46 people infected died in Thailand and Vietnam. In 2005, 43 of 82 people infected died in 5 Asian countries. In 2006, 79 of 115 people infected died in 9 countries including the Middle East and African areas. In 2007, 59 of 88 people infected died in 9 countries. In 2008, 33 of 44 people died in 6 countries. In 2009, 32 of 73 people infected died in 5 countries. In 2010, 24 of 48 people infected died in 5 countries. In 2011,  34 of 62 infected died in 5 countries. So far in 2012, 17 of 28 infected people died in 6 countries. Officials believe that there are many more unreported cases of H5N1 infections.

Avian influenza refers to "influenza caused by viruses adapted to birds." A subtype of avian infleunza named H5N1 is able to adapt to humans causing an influenza pandemic. This strain of influenza is spreading globally after first appearing in Asia. On October 10, 2011 the WHO announced a total of 566 confirmed human cases which resulted in the deaths of 332 people since 2003. Tens of millions of birds have died of H5N1 influenza and hundreds of millions of birds have been slaughtered and disposed of, to limit the spread of H5N1. Studies have indicated that these strains of influenza continue to evolve and mutate, expanding its host reservoir. Human-to-human transmission has not been found, however a mutation that allows this will surely bring a deadly pandemic.</history>

    <name>Global Climate Change</name>

    <info>

      <history>It is estimated that, for the past 600,000 years or so, our planet has gone through many cycles of moderate climate change; each cycle has been roughly the same repeat of the previous one before it and the conditions (concentrations of carbon dioxide, sea levels, etc.) that caused these changes have also been around the same. In the recent decades though, the conditions that once evoked these moderate changes in the climate have all changed drastically. These once moderate concentrations have increased exponentially more than ever before and are now causing the climates in several parts of the planet to change completely from what they once were. Starting with the industrial revolution and on the concentration of green house gases in the atmosphere have skyrocketed.

Over the past several decades, the global climate has been changing at a much faster rate than it normally did in the past and it is affecting areas around the world in several different ways. There is physical evidence in many parts of the world to support this argument, glaciers that once ran for miles just a few decades ago are barely visible today, sea levels have risen at much more dramatic rates than is normally expected, and patterns of precipitation have changed throughout the world as well. These events and many more are largely due to how careless humans have been when it comes to evironmental and climate concerns. The amount of green house gases that surrounds the planet and keeps a respected temperature for each part of the globe have increased at an exponential rate. These are largely a result of human activities in the past decades.</history>
