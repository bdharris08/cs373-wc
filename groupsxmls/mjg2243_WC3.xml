			<history>Bath Salts are legal designer drugs sold as "bath salts" where users snort the bath salts for a high similar to amphetamines. The chemicals in bath salts have been around for almost a century but in the last decade bath salts have emerged in mainstream America as a legal way to get "high." The drug first came to the attention of authorities in 2010 after reports from U.S. poison centers.</history>

					<misc>According to a CDC report of bath salt abusers in Michigan, users not only experience psychological side effects -- there were physical ones too. In fact, 91 percent of users had neurological damage, while 77 percent experienced cardiovascular damage and 49 percent had psychological difficulties associated with the drug. Those difficulties could be severe: 37 percent of the people who suffered mental health problems reported attempting suicide or having suicidal thoughts, related to bath salts.</misc>

The 2011 edition of the annual U.S. dollar billionaires ranking compiled by Forbes Magazine broke new records, both in terms of the number of billionaires (1210) and their total wealth (US $4.5 trillion.) The Sunday Times Rich List for 2012 showed that the UK's wealthiest were richer than they had ever been, with a combined fortune of £414 billion.</misc>

            <history>The US Congress created the War Department in 1789 and the Navy Department in 1798. In 1945 President Truman proposed the creation of a unified department of state defense, citing both wasteful military spending and inter-departmental conflicts. In 1947, President Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947, which set up a unified military command known as the National Military Establishment. The National Military Establishment was renamed the Department of Defense on August 10, 1949, in an amendment to the original 1947 law.</history>

            <history>The Federal Reserve System was created on December 23, 1913 through the Federal Reserve Act. This was in response to a series of panics, particularly the Panic of 1907 when the NYSE fell almost 50% from its peak the previous year. Since then, the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System have expanded and the structure has evolved. Ben Bernanke is the current Chairman of the Federal Reserve System.</history>

        <misc>According to the Board of Governors, the Federal Reserve is independent within government in that "its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government." Its authority is derived from statutes enacted by the U.S. Congress and the System is subject to congressional oversight. </misc>

        <info>
            <type>An international assembly of 193 member states</type>
            <history>The United Nations was established in 1945 to replace the League of Nations, which failed to prevent World War II. The main goal of the organization is to maintain international peace and promote cooperation in solving international problems. The UN Conference on International Organization began on April 25, 1945 with 50 governments in attendance. The UN Charter was ratified on October 24, 1945 by France, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom (the five permanent members of the Security Council at the time) as well as a majority of the other 46 signatories. The UN was originally based at the Sperry Gyroscope Corporation's facility in Lake Success, New York, from 1946-1952, before being moved to the UN Headquarters building in Manhattan. The United Nations currently has 193 member states.</history>

She graduated with a degree in Criminal Justice from Bemidji State University of Minnesota in 1978 and went on to work as a police officer in Baltimore Maryland before moving into the DEA in 1980. She spent the next several years moving up the ranks in the DEA before becoming the Special Agent in charge of the Los Angeles Field Division which put her in charge of all enforcement and administrative operations in Los Angeles, Nevada, Hawaii, Guam, and Saipan. This made her the first female ever promoted to the position of "Special Agent in Charge." She was nominated in 2008 by former President George W. Bush to replace the recently retired Administrator, and she was nominated again by President Barack Obama to the position of Administrator.</biography>

Kim Jong-un, his father and predecessor, died on the 28th of December, 2011 to screams of mourning of his citizens. Allegedly, North Koreans were forced to cry to show a proper amount of respect. Regardless of the validity of these claims, it can be said that the political regime in Pyongyang is hostile, complicated, and completely focused on the Supreme Leader. As a result, it is not yet clear how the shift in leadership to Kim Jong-un will affect North Korea's previously belligerent nature, and the possibility of the country's continued development of nuclear weapons has left the world in an ongoing crisis.</biography>
