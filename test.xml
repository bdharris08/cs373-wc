            <kind>An international assembly of 193 member states</kind>
            <description>The United Nations was established in 1945 to replace the League of Nations, which failed to prevent World War II. The main goal of the organization is to maintain international peace and promote cooperation in solving international problems. The UN Conference on International Organization began on April 25, 1945 with 50 governments in attendance. The UN Charter was ratified on October 24, 1945 by France, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom (the five permanent members of the Security Council at the time) as well as a majority of the other 46 signatories. The UN was originally based at the Sperry Gyroscope Corporation's facility in Lake Success, New York, from 1946-1952, before being moved to the UN Headquarters building in Manhattan. The United Nations currently has 193 member states.</description>
            <relationToCrisis>Since 1959, the UN has passed four resolutions on Tibet (in 1959, 1961, 1965, and 1991). Since then, there have been motions to hold China accountable for its actions in Tibet, but lobbying by China has blocked any progress.</relationToCrisis>
