	 time) as well as a majority of the other 46 signatories. The UN was originally based at the
	 Sperry Gyroscope Corporation's facility in Lake Success, New York, from 1946-1952, before
	 being moved to the UN Headquarters building in Manhattan. The United Nations currently has 		 193 member states.
