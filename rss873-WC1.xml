            <humanImpact>According to a CDC report of bath salt abusers in Michigan, users not only experience psychological side effects -- there were physical ones too. In fact, 91 percent of users had neurological damage, while 77 percent experienced cardiovascular damage and 49 percent had psychological difficulties associated with the drug. Those difficulties could be severe: 37 percent of the people who suffered mental health problems reported attempting suicide or having suicidal thoughts, related to bath salts.</humanImpact>

            <description>The DEA was established on July 1, 1973 by Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973 which was signed by President Richard Nixon on July 28, 1973. The plan proposed the creation of a single federal agency to enforce federal drug laws and consolidate and coordinated the government's drug control activities. Congress accepted the proposal and the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs and the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement merged o create the DEA. The current DEA Administrator is Michele Leonhart and the current DEA Chief of Operations is Thomas M. Harrigan.</description>
            <relationToCrisis>The DEA is attempting to crack down on Bath Salts on the local and national level. There are many elements used to synthesize bath salts and the DEA is trying to get them added to the federal list of illegal substances. If this is accomplished, it will make it easier to prosecute the criminals who import, sell, and possess the chemicals.</relationToCrisis>

In 1947, President Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947, which set up a unified military command known as the National Military Establishment. The National Military Establishment was renamed the Department of Defense on August 10, 1949, in an amendment to the original 1947 law.</description>

This was in response to a series of panics, particularly the Panic of 1907 when the NYSE fell almost 50% from its peak the previous year. Since then, the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System have expanded and the structure has evolved. Ben Bernanke is the current Chairman of the Federal Reserve System.</description>

            <description>The United Nations was established in 1945 to replace the League of Nations, which failed to prevent World War II. The main goal of the organization is to maintain international peace and promote cooperation in solving international problems. The UN Conference on International Organization began on April 25, 1945 with 50 governments in attendance. The UN Charter was ratified on October 24, 1945 by France, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom (the five permanent members of the Security Council at the time) as well as a majority of the other 46 signatories. The UN was originally based at the Sperry Gyroscope Corporation's facility in Lake Success, New York, from 1946-1952, before being moved to the UN Headquarters building in Manhattan. The United Nations currently has 193 member states.</description>
            <relationToCrisis>Since 1959, the UN has passed four resolutions on Tibet (in 1959, 1961, 1965, and 1991). Since then, there have been motions to hold China accountable for its actions in Tibet, but lobbying by China has blocked any progress.</relationToCrisis>

            <description>Michele Marie Leonhart is an American career law enforcement officer and currently the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency. She graduated with a degree in Criminal Justice from Bemidji State University of Minnesota in 1978 and went on to work as a police officer in Baltimore Maryland before moving into the DEA in 1980. She spent the next several years moving up the ranks in the DEA before becoming the Special Agent in charge of the Los Angeles Field Division which put her in charge of all enforcement and administrative operations in Los Angeles, Nevada, Hawaii, Guam, and Saipan. This made her the first female ever promoted to the position of "Special Agent in Charge." She was nominated in 2008 by former President George W. Bush to replace the recently retired Administrator, and she was nominated again by President Barack Obama to the position of Administrator.</description>

            <kind>Supreme Commander of North Korea</kind>
            <birthday>Jan 8, 1983/1984</birthday>
            <nationality>North Korea</nationality>
            <description>Kim Jong-un is the Supreme Leader of North Korea, First Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, First Chairman of the National Defence Commission, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission in North Korea. Kim Jong-un, his father and predecessor, died on the 28th of December, 2011 to screams of mourning of his citizens. Allegedly, North Koreans were forced to cry to show a proper amount of respect. Regardless of the validity of these claims, it can be said that the political regime in Pyongyang is hostile, complicated, and completely focused on the Supreme Leader. As a result, it is not yet clear how the shift in leadership to Kim Jong-un will affect North Korea's previously belligerent nature, and the possibility of the country's continued development of nuclear weapons has left the world in an ongoing crisis.</description>
