<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Kim Jong-un is the Supreme Leader of North Korea, First Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, First Chairman of the National Defence Commission, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission in North Korea. Kim Jong-un, his father and predecessor, died on the 28th of December, 2011 to screams of mourning of his citizens. Allegedly, North Koreans were forced to cry to show a proper amount of respect. Regardless of the validity of these claims, it can be said that the political regime in Pyongyang is hostile, complicated, and completely focused on the Supreme Leader. As a result, it is not yet clear how the shift in leadership to Kim Jong-un will affect North Korea's previously belligerent nature, and the possibility of the country's continued development of nuclear weapons has left the world in an ongoing crisis.
