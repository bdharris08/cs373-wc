<h3>The DEA and Bath Salts</h3>
<p> 
The DEA is attempting to crack down on Bath Salts on the local and national level. There are many elements used to synthesize bath salts and the DEA is trying to get them added to the federal list of illegal substances. If this is accomplished, it will make it easier to prosecute the criminals who import, sell, and possess the chemicals.
